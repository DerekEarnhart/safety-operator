"""Safety Operator package.

This package provides a simple, modelâ€‘agnostic safety mechanism for AI
systems. It includes a safety operator that projects outputs into a
safe region, dampens unsafe components, and applies an optional
regularization towards aligned behaviors. See the README.md for
installation and usage examples.
